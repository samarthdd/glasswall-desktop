## Current Objective and Key Results
**Objective:**
1. Just drag and drop the files from your local hard disk, and the Glasswall Desktop will rebuild them using the Glasswall Rebuild API (currently hosted on Azure).
2. To support different directory structures, give freedom to save the files at custom directory structure or at default location by maintaining the same directory as that of the parent folder.
3. To support different platforms (Windows, MAC and Linux)
4. To provide online and offline file-rebuild support. The online version to use glasswall-rebuild cloud hosting of rebuild engine to rebuild files. The offline version to use glasswall docker image to provide the ame functions offline.
5. So for running the offline mode user has to install the docker on the respective OS (Windows/MAC/Ubuntu) https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/

* Choose the files to rebuild and the target directory.

* For first time installations, the application will pull the glasswallsolutions/evaluationsdk:1 docker image from docker-hub registry.

![glasswall-docker Screenshot](img/gw_docker_image.png)

* For first time rebuild, the application will ask for user permission to share file systems with docker

![glasswall-docker Screenshot](img/docker_share_notification.png)


Allow by clicking "Share It".

* To avoid this notification in future, note the "temp" directory that the application asks to allow access to. Follow below steps to add this directory permanently in docker file sharing settings to avoid these notifications in the future

* Open "Docker-Settings" from systemtray


![glasswall-docker Screenshot](img/open_docker_setting.png)

* Open "File-Sharing" tab and click on the "+" icon

* Add the diectory noted above, for which the notification appears

Once added, further rebuilds will not prompt to allow sharing the directory each time when using docker to rebuild files.

## Troubleshooting
* MAC Application: Incase of cloud rebuild failure, follow below steps:
* Delete the **config** folder under this path /Users/<system-user>/Library/Application\Support/glasswall-desktop
* On command prompt run this command **rm -rf config* ** to delete all the content in above path
* Incase docker is not installed and user installs the docker, while desktop app is in running state, user is requested to relaunch the desktop app.
* To run on Linux systems as non-root user, make sure to follow this link to allow the user to access docker - https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/
